**Congratulations** you made it another day of being employed in the wild world of data science.  
I hope you leave with a greater appreciation for the field. Your boss found your work adequate!   
Feel free to use this space to try different seaborn graph types with the same data and see what cool things you can come with.  
Don't be discouraged here are some real life monsters I have made before through pure incompetence :)
