Once you're happy with your graph and with minutes to spare until you have to send this graph you need to save it to your computer to send on.  

Saving a graph is a simple as:

```python
  
plt.savefig(<file_name>)
  
```

Try it yourself and see if you can open your finished graph in your OS's image viewer!.
